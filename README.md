# LearnOpenGL C
This started with me being bored & saying "I'ma learn C" why not?<br>
To help learn C I chose to use OpenGL/GLFW as I was already semi-used to it.

## Building
I'm still new to cmake as of writing this so it may not build, feel free to try anyway...

I started this project on windows in CLion.
I have no idea if this will work on Linux & will now support mac.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/CoffeeCatRailway/LearnOpenGL-C
cd LearnOpenGL-C
cmake .. //Not sure if this is needed
cmake --build .
```

Note: I do not own some of the textures and/or models in the `resources` folder
